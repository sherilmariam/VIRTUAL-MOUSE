# Virtual Mouse

## Overview
The Virtual Mouse project aims to develop a virtual mouse system using Python and OpenCV, allowing users to interact with their computers through hand gestures captured by a camera. By eliminating the need for a physical mouse, this system provides a more intuitive and potentially more efficient way for users to control their computers, particularly in scenarios where traditional input devices may be impractical or inaccessible.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking using the MediaPipe library.
- Mapping of hand movements to mouse movements and actions on the computer screen.
- User-friendly interface for calibrating and fine-tuning the virtual mouse system.
- Support for basic mouse functionalities such as cursor movement and click actions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/sherilmariam/VIRTUAL-MOUSE.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script:
   python main.py
2. Position your hand in front of the camera to control the virtual mouse.
3. Move your hand to move the cursor on the screen.
4. Perform gestures (e.g., finger movements) to simulate mouse clicks and other actions.
