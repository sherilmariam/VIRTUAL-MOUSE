# Virtual Mouse

## Overview
The Virtual Mouse project aims to develop a virtual mouse system using Python and OpenCV, allowing users to interact with their computers through hand gestures captured by a camera. By eliminating the need for a physical mouse, this system provides a more intuitive and potentially more efficient way for users to control their computers, particularly in scenarios where traditional input devices may be impractical or inaccessible.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking using the MediaPipe library.
- Mapping of hand movements to mouse movements and actions on the computer screen.
- User-friendly interface for calibrating and fine-tuning the virtual mouse system.
- Support for basic mouse functionalities such as cursor movement and click actions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PyAutoGUI
